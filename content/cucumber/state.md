It's important to prevent state created by one Scenario from leaking into others.
Leaking state makes your Scenarios brittle, and difficult to run in isolation.

* Avoid using global or static variables.

* Make sure you clean your database between Scenarios.

# Sharing state between steps

It's possible to store object state in variables inside your Step Definitions.

State can make your steps more tightly coupled and harder to reuse.

## Dependency Injection in Java
If your programming language is Java you will be writing glue code
([Step Definitions](/cucumber/#step-definitions) and [Hooks](/cucumber/#hooks)) in plain old Java classes.

Cucumber will create a new instance of each of your glue code classes before each Scenario.

If all of your glue code classes have an empty constructor, you donâ€™t need anything else.
However, most projects will benefit from a Dependency Injection module to organize your code better and to share state between Step Definitions.

The available Dependency Injection modules are:

- [PicoContainer](#picocontainer) (The recommended one if your application doesn't use another DI container)
- [Spring](#spring)
- [Guice](#guice)
- [OpenEJB](#openejb)
- [Weld](#weld)
- [Needle](#needle)

### PicoContainer

To use PicoContainer, add the following dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
    <artifactId>cucumber-picocontainer</artifactId>
    <version>{{ site.versions.cucumber_jvm }}</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

There is no documentation yet, but the code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/tree/master/picocontainer).

### Spring

To use Spring, add the following dependency:

```xml
<dependency>

    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

# Databases

## The Before Hook Approach

The recommended approach to clean a database between Scenarios is to use a
`Before`[Hook](/cucumber/#hooks) to remove all data *before* a Scenario starts.

This is usually better than using an `After`[Hook](/cucumber/#hooks), as it allows
you to perform a post-mortem inspection of the database if a Scenario fails.

An alternative approach is to use database transactions.

## The Database Transaction Approach

You can wrap a transaction (if your database supports it) *around* each Scenario.

(This might lead to faster Scenarios, but it comes at a cost.
You won't be able to perform a post-mortem, and you won't be able to
use [Browser Automation](/browser-automation/)).

You simply tell Cucumber to start a transaction in a `Before`[Hook](/cucumber/#hooks), and later
roll it back in an `After`[Hook](/cucumber/#hooks).

This is such a common thing to do that several Cucumber extensions provide ready-to-use
[Tagged Hooks](/cucumber/#tagged-hooks) using a Tag named `@txn`.

To enable it, you must tag every [Feature](/gherkin/#feature) or [Scenario](/gherkin/#scenario) that requires
transactions with `@txn`:

```gherkin
@txn
Feature: Let's write a lot of stuff to the DB

  Scenario: I clean up after myself
    Given I write to the DB

  Scenario: And so do I!
    Given I write to the DB
```

### With JUnit and Spring

The [`cucumber-spring`](#dependency-injection-in-java) module contains `@txn` Hooks in the `cucumber.api.spring` package.

This package isn't on your glue path by default, so you have to add it yourself in your
Configuration Options.

```java
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(glue = {"your.own.glue.code", "cucumber.api.spring"})
public class RunCukesTest {
}
```

See the [`spring-txn`](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/tree/master/examples/spring-txn) example in Cucumber-JVM for a minimal setup.

# Browsers, beware

If you're using a [Browser Automation](/browser-automation/) tool that talks to your application over HTTP the transactional approach
will not work if your [Step Definitions](/cucumber/#step-definitions) and the web application serving HTTP request each have their own database connection.

If this is the case you should use the brute-force approach where the data is explicitly deleted before each Scenario.
