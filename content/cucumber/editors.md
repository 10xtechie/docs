Most popular text editors support for Gherkin syntax highlighting.

Some IDEs also have advanced support for Cucumber, such as running Cucumber
from within the IDE, Displaying results, navigating between Gherkin steps and
Step Definitions and so on.

This page lists some of the editors/IDEs, and how to use them with Cucumber.
