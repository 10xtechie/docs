Using Cucumber in your project is easier with the right tools.

# Editors and IDEs

Most popular text editors support Gherkin syntax highlighting.

Some IDEs also have advanced support for Cucumber, such as running Cucumber
from within the IDE, displaying results, navigating between Gherkin steps and
step definitions and so on.
