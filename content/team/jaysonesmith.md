I'm a huge Cucumber supporter, Rubyist, Gopher, and host of the [Phoenix chapter of the Ministry of Testing](https://www.meetup.com/Ministry-of-Testing-Phoenix/) ([twitter](https://twitter.com/MOTPhx)). I've mainly contributed to the cucumber-ruby repo in my time here, but have done some other bits and bobs like coordinating our changelog file homogeneity. My girlfriend and I currently live in hot, hot heat of Arizona in the US with our four furbaby cats.
