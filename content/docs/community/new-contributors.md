Every Friday at 8am PST we host the new contributors ensemble. This is a space for people who are keen to contribute to open source to get together and support each other in making their first contributions. 🦄

![New contributors ensemble](https://docs.cucumber.io/img/new-contributors-ensemble.jpg)

The Cucumber team is committed to [tackling the structural sexism and racism](https://cucumber.io/blog/open-source/tackling-structural-racism-(and-sexism)-in-open-so/) in open source, and we host these sessions to provide a welcoming environment for people who have historically been under-represented in open source. ✊🏿🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️

You can watch it live on https://twitch.tv/cucumberbdd or watch old sessions on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrQMyTCtW0DZolJHWBLELne1EF2gqMaHc). You can also read our [manifesto](https://docs.cucumber.io/img/mob-manifesto-v3.png).

Everyone is welcome! If you'd like to join in, [sign up for the Community Slack](https://cucumberbdd-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/) and head over to the [#new-contributors](https://cucumberbdd.slack.com/archives/C028E2TBDJQ) channel and say hello. 

If you're new to open source and feeling a bit nervous 😳, we understand! We recommend watching [this excellent guide](https://egghead.io/talks/git-how-to-make-your-first-open-source-contribution) to give you a grounding in some of the basic concepts. We want you to feel safe to make mistakes, and ask questions.
